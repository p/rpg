Create or update the remote package index. Maybe.

Options
  -d <days>             Do nothing if db is less than <days> days old
  -m <mins>             Do nothing if db is less than <mins> minutes old

The -s option is used by various pgem commands when an update may be
neccassary. Its default stale time can be configured by setting the

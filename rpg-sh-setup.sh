# This file is sourced by all `rpg-*` utilities. It handles environment
# setup and provides utility functions.
#
# A typical rpg program should look like this:
#
#     #!/bin/sh
#     # Launch a rocket missile or something like that.
#     set -e
#     . rpg-sh-setup

#     ARGV="$@"

# Install Paths
# -------------

# This is the psuedo root directory where `rpg` keeps all its stuff. The
# default locations of all other rpg paths use this as a base.
# *HOWEVER*, no rpg utility targets this directory -- every significant
# location must have a separate path variable so that things stay
# flexible in configuration.
: ${RPGPATH:=/var/lib/rpg}

# `RPGLIB` is the shared Ruby `lib` directory where library files are
# installed. You can set this to the current Ruby's site packages with:
#
#     RPGLIB=$(ruby_sitelibdir)
: ${RPGLIB:=$RPGPATH/lib}

# `RPGBIN` is where executable scripts included in packages are installed.
: ${RPGBIN:=$RPGPATH/bin}

# `RPGMAN` is where manpages included with packages are installed. This
# is basically the whole reason `rpg` was written in the first place.
: ${RPGMAN:=$RPGPATH/man}

# RPG Paths
# ---------

# `RPGCACHE` is where `rpg-fetch(1)` looks for and stores gem files.
# Set this to your Rubygems `cache` directory to share the gem cache.
: ${RPGCACHE:=$RPGPATH/cache}

# `RPGPACKS` is where `rpg-install(1)` unpacks gems before installing. The
# package directories are not used after package installation is complete.
: ${RPGPACKS:=$RPGPATH/packs}

# `RPGDB` is where the local package database is kept. It's a
# filesystem hierarchy. It looks like this:
#
#     $RPGDB/
#     |-- ronn
#     |   |-- 0.4
#     |   |-- 0.4.1
#     |   `-- active -> 0.4.1
#     |-- sinatra
#     |   |-- 0.9.4
#     |   |-- 0.9.6
#     |   `-- active -> 0.9.6
#     |-- stemmer
#     |   |-- 1.0.1
#     |   `-- active -> 1.0.1
#     |-- syntax
#     |   |-- 1.0.0
#     |   `-- active -> 1.0.0
#     `-- turn
#         |-- 0.7.0
#         `-- active -> 0.10.0
#
# The database is meant to be "stable". That is, you can write programs
# that rely on this structure. Maybe it should be documented first.
: ${RPGDB:=$RPGPATH/db}

# `RPGINDEX` is where the index of available gems is kept. It's a
# directory. The `rpg-update(1)` program manages the files under it.
#
#   * `release`:
#     All available packages and all versions of all packages. Each line is a
#     `<package> <version>` pair, separated by whitespace. The file is sorted
#     alphabetically by package  name, reverse by version number, such that the
#     first line for a package is the most recent version.
#
#   * `release-recent`:
#     The most recent versions of all packages. The format is otherwise
#     identical to the `release` file. This mostly exists so that
#     `join(1)` can be used on it. Otherwise, we'd just build it from
#     `release` when we needed it.
#
#   * `prerelease`:
#     **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.**
#     This is the same as `release` but includes only prelease packages.
#
#   * `prerelease-recent`:
#     **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.**
#     This is the same as `release-recent` but includes only prelease
#     packages.

# Usage Messages, Logging, and Stuff Like That
# --------------------------------------------

# The program name used in usage messages, log output, and other places
# probably. You can set this before sourcing rpg-sh-setup to override
# the default `$(basename $0)` value but it's probably what you want.
: ${PROGNAME:=$(basename $0)}

# The progam's usage message. See the documentation for the `USAGE`
# function for information on setting this and how it plays with the
# other usage related functions.
: ${__USAGE__:='${PROGNAME} <args>'}

# This is the main usage setting thingy. Scripts should start as
# follows to take advantage of it:
#
#     set -e           # always
#     . rpg-sh-setup  # bring in support lib
#
#     ARGV="$@"
#     USAGE '${PROGNAME} <options> ...
#     A short, preferably < 50 char description of the script.
#
#     Options:
#       -b               Booooyaaahhh.'
#
# That will automatically trigger option parsing for a `--help`
# argument and whatnot.
#
# Note that the string passed in is single-quote escape. The string will
# evaluated at help time so you can do wild/expensive interpolations if
# that's your thing.
#
# One more quick usage tip. Some scripts want to show usage when `$@` is
# empty and others don't. These `USAGE` routines default to *not*
# showing the usage message when no arguments were passed. If you want
# to show usage when no arguments are passed, put this immediately
# before setting the `ARGV` variable:
#
#     [ "$*" ] || set -- --help
#     ARGV="$@"
#     USAGE ...
#
# That'll cause empty arg invocations to show the help message.

# Show usage message defined in USAGE environment variable. The usage message
# is first evaluated as a string so interpolations can be performed if
# necessary.

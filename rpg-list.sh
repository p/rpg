# The `rpg-list` program compares installed packages to packages available
# in the remote repository. It's useful for determining the versions of
# packages and how they relate to same named packages available in the
# repository.
#
# This is somewhere between a plumbing and porcelain command. It's useful
# for building other programs and provides options for generating easily
# parseable output. However, it's also useful to humans and the default
# output is optimize for human consumption.

USAGE '${PROGNAME} [-u] [-a] [-p|-s] [<glob>...]
List installed and/or available packages.

Passing one or more <glob>s filters the list to matching packages.

Options
  -a               Include packages available but not installed
  -u               Sync the package index with remote repository first
  -p               Generate easily parseable output
  -s               Write package names only (no versions or status)'

# -----------

# The `-p` argument causes the output to be varied slightly. These variables
# control how output lines are formatted and what symbols they use. In
# parsey mode, simple alpha characters are used since those are a bit easier
# to `grep` / `sed` without escaping.

# Main Pipeline
# -------------

# Kick off a pipeline by listing installed packages. The output from
# `rpg-package-list` looks something like this:
#
#
#     RedCloth                       4.2.3
#     abstract                       1.0.0
#     actionmailer                   2.3.5
#     actionpack                     2.3.5
#     activerecord                   2.3.5
#     activeresource                 2.3.5
#     activesupport                  2.3.5
#     ansi                           1.1.0
#     builder                        2.1.2
#     classifier                     1.3.1
#     coffee-script                  0.3.2
#     ...
#
# So we have the `<package> <version>` pairs separated by whitespace,
# basically.

# Okay ...
#
# This is going to blow your mind.
#
# Use `join(1)` to perform a relational join between the installed
# package list and the recent release list from the index. The recent
# release list looks nearly identical, format-wise, to the installed
# list.
#
# There's a few things needed for this to work properly. First, both
# files need to be sorted (as with `sort -b`) on the join field. Here,
# the join field is the `<package>` -- we don't need to specify it
# explicitly on the command line because it's the first field in both
# files.
#
# The stream text that comes out of `join(1)` looks like:
#
#     <package> <installed-version> <available-version>
#
# Without any other options, `join(1)` performs an "inner join",
# excluding unpaired lines from output entirely. Which is great because
# that's exactly what we need to determine which packages are out of
# date.
#
# This is a really insanely fast operation because it need only take a
# single pass over each file. It simply walks through each file line by
# line and, because both files are sorted, knows immediately whether the
# lines intersect or are unpairable.
#
# Additional, we selectively enable some of `join(1)`'s other options (`-a`
# and `-e`) for achieving "outer joins" and "full joins" when querying
# against all remote packages.

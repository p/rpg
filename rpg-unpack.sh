# The `rpg-unpack` program reads the gem file's internal tar-based structure
# and either untars into a new directory or writes the data segment's tar
# stream to stdout.
#
# Gem files are more or less normal tarballs that looks like this:
#
#     $ tar tv < sinatra-0.9.6.gem
#     -rw-r--r-- wheel/wheel  117190 1969-12-31 16:00:00 data.tar.gz
#     -rw-r--r-- wheel/wheel    1225 1969-12-31 16:00:00 metadata.gz
#
# The `metadata.gz` file is a gzip compressed YAML gemspec. The
# `data.tar.gz` holds the unprefixed files.
#
# There's also an older gem format apparently, but I'm hoping to not have to
# deal with it.

USAGE '${PROGNAME} [-p <path>|-P] <package> [<version>]
       ${PROGNAME} -c [-m] <package> [<version>]
Unpack a gem file to disk or as a tar stream on standard output.

Options
  -c               Write gem data tar stream to stdout. Do not create any files.
  -f               Unpack over an existing directory.
  -m               Change the behavior of the -c option. Write gem metadata
                   segment instead of the data segment.
  -n               Do nothing if unpack directory already exists.
  -p <path>        Unpack under <path> instead of the working directory.
  -P               Unpack under RPGPACKS instead of the working directory.

The <package> may be a package name or path to a gem file on disk. When a
package name is given, the <version> may also be specified.'

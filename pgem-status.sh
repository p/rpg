# Okay ...
#
# This is going to blow your mind.
#
# Use `join(1)` to perform a relational join between the installed
# package list and the recent release list from the index. The recent
# release list looks nearly identical, format-wise, to the installed
# list.
#
# There's a few things needed for this to work properly. First, both
# files need to be sorted (as with `sort -b`) on the join field. Here,
# the join field is the `<package>` -- we don't need to specify it
# explicitly on the command line because it's the first field in both
# files.
#
# The stream text that comes out of `join(1)` looks like:
#
#     <package> <installed-version> <available-version>
#
# Without any other options, `join(1)` performs an "inner join",
# excluding unpaired lines from output entirely. Which is great because
# that's exactly what we need to determine which packages are out of
# date.
#
# This is a really insanely fast operation because it need only take a
# single pass over each file. It simply walks through each file line by
# line and, because both files are sorted, knows immediately whether the
# lines intersect or are unpairable.
#
# Additional, we selectively enable some of `join(1)`'s other options (`-a`
# and `-e`) for achieving "outer joins" and "full joins" when querying
# against all remote packages.
